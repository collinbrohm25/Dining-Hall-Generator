# Dining-Hall-Generator
Projected Designed By: Collin Brohm (811-60-7527) and Chief Ogundu (811-11-9676)
The purpose of the project is to have the program pick a UGA Dining Hall, and print some available options at the Dining Hall. We didn't utilize any extra tools besides importing the Math.random function, as our project is simple but effective. Our team ran into the problem if a user inputs a number that is not an integer, but we solved it with a while loop.
